                    <p>At the 2015 conference, two representatives of our team (Alexander Sikand '16 and Ethan Ma '15) presented our paper that analyzed various successful humanitarian efforts in relation to the nuclear nonproliferation movement. <em> Abstract: </em> In response to this year’s theme of the Critical Issues Forum, our paper will propose a humanitarian approach to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. To model our solution, we look to the varying levels of success humanitarian efforts have had in regard to slavery, chemical weapons, land mines, and CFCs. We then analyze the factors that led to each movement’s successes and failures. These precedents will guide us on the path to a more peaceful future, and through an understanding of the humanitarian initiatives of the past, we will be better able to lay the foundation for a world without nuclear weapons.</p>
