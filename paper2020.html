                <p><i>Abstract: </i>   Ever since the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the world now has a heightened vigilance for potentially catastrophic nuclear activities, and until nuclear nonproliferation begins, no country will dare to lower its guard. In a more interconnected world where international relationships and cooperation are increasingly important, multilateral action to combat rogue agents has kept any further nuclear bombings from occurring. Yet the problem has not been fully addressed and tens of thousands of nuclear weapons are operational at any moment. Comprehensive disarmament will be difficult, but as tensions escalate, it will become all the more necessary and imperative. <p> </p>

The recent termination of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty by the U.S. and Russia, has shaken up the post cold-war security environment. Now, there are no longer any constraints over the ability to produce intermediate range nuclear missiles. The escalating political tensions and failure of diplomacy and treaties show signs of the beginnings of a new nuclear arms race. Unfortunately, the threat of nuclear weapons is rising and we currently have approximately 13,890 nuclear weapons in the world. Moreover, China is building its nuclear arsenal, North Korea is expanding its nuclear capabilities, the U.S. and Russia are modernizing their portfolio with new technologies like hypersonic missiles, cyber technologies, and underwater drones capable of carrying nuclear weapons, and India, Pakistan, and Iran are the rising stars not bound by any treaty. Nuclear proliferation is a very real issue facing us today and we should take all steps necessary to ensure the survival of the human race. With the demise of INF, mutual trust, diplomacy, restraint, and continuous constructive dialogue is critical to maintaining world peace. Unity of NATO will be put to test as the potential deployment of ground-based intermediate-range missile systems will become a part of the transatlantic security discussions. In this global world, we need multilateral treaties which include all new advancing technologies and creative solutions for strict enforcement of full and verifiable compliance of treaties. <p> </p>

In a future where the youth live in a digital world, online education is the most potent and pragmatic channel to generate awareness and communicate the issue of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. In the past decade, the youth have risen together in various movements to protest issues such as gun violence, gender inequality, and climate change, garnering support and inspiring each other in a rippling effect through the use of all types of social media platforms. Their call to action is not only rapid, but effective. From then eight-year-old Mari Copeny whose letter paved President Obama’s aid to clean water in Flint, Michigan, to now 16-year-old climate change activist Greta Thunberg, youth’s outreach towards policy-making adults and activism on social media has inspired millions to join their cause. Therefore, by promoting and sharing the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons and the urgency for nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament on social media platforms, the youth of today can not only bring these issues to the attention of adults who can make sustainable changes, but they will become leaders of a safer world without nuclear weapons.
