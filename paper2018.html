                <p><i>Abstract: </i>    We are witnessing the beginnings of the “New Cold War” between the U.S, China, Russia, and North Korea. The Trump administration’s National Security Strategy, unveiled in December 2017, asserts that “The United States will respond to the growing political, economic, and military competitions we face around the world. China and Russia challenge American power, influence, and interests.” President Putin recently flaunted new powerful weapons like nuclear armed cruise missiles, and China recently ended term limits, opening up to the possibility of a dictatorship. North Korea has been aggravating the United States for several years by testing long range missiles and spreading propaganda about the ability to strike several foreign nations. <p> </p>

Though we have avoided World War III for seventy years, the threat of the next world war will loom over our heads in such uncertain times as long as nuclear weapons exist. The nuclear threat is on the rise due to the development of MIRVs and ICBMs, especially in North Korea. Growing distrust among the world leaders is prompting dramatic policy changes and the risk of a nuclear disaster is much more real than we would like to believe. <p> </p> 

The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), also known as the Nuclear Weapon Ban Treaty, is a legally binding agreement signed by 50 countries banning the possession, development, and deployment of nuclear weapons with the ultimate goal of total elimination. Drafted by the UN in response to the growing nuclear threat, the treaty was adopted on July 7, 2017. On September 20, 2017, the treaty opened for signature. Currently five states have ratified it (Cuba, Guyana, Holy See, Mexico and Thailand), but a total of 50 ratifications are needed for the treaty to enter into force. <p> </p>

While the TPNW aims to prevent further development of nuclear weapons, it is a legally binding agreement signed by 50 countries banning the possession, development, and deployment of nuclear weapons with the ultimate goal of totally eliminating them. Should the entire world cooperate with the treaty, the nuclear threat will theoretically be reduced to zero. While several important nations, including countries that possess nuclear weapons, have not yet ratified the treaty, it is an important step towards preserving peace and unity in the world by reducing tensions and eliminating the threat of nuclear arms and we need to focus all our efforts to ensure the treaty will enter into force. Future activities such as peace talks, sanctions, and additional bilateral treaties should help the TPNW come into effect. In the future, treaties such as the TPNW will greatly reduce the growing global nuclear threat and restore peace and harmony among world leaders.
